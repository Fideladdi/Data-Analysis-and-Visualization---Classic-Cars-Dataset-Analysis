# Data-Analysis-and-Visualization---Classic-Cars-Dataset-Analysis

This project involves the analysis of a dataset containing details on 406 classic cars from 1970 to 1982. The dataset includes eight characteristics such as make and model, fuel economy, engine displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, and country of origin.

Objective
The main objective of this project was to use Python's data manipulation libraries to answer three key questions about engine efficiency and popularity based on the provided dataset:
1. Identify the year of production in which the most efficient engines were produced, measured by fuel economy.
2. Determine which region produces the most efficient engines, calculated as horsepower per cubic inch of engine displacement.
3. Analyze the popularity of engine sizes based on cylinder count across different countries of origin.

Approach
To accomplish the objectives, I employed the following methodologies:
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset using appropriate file handling techniques.
- Utilized `groupby()`, `pivot_table()`, and `crosstab()` functions from pandas for data aggregation and summarization.
- Calculated engine efficiency and made comparisons across years and regions.
- Analyzed engine size popularity based on cylinder count for each country of origin.
